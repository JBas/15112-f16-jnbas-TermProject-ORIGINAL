This project primarily allows users to practice their music by generating musical notes from an audio file, using the aubio module to detect the frequencies in the sound file. This project also allows users to compose their own music and save it. Both modes have a playback feature, which utilises the pyaduio module. To run, ensure that the aubio and pyaudio modules have been installed:


To install the aubio module on Mac OS X:

- To install Homebrew, go to http://brew.sh, and copy the latest script. In the Terminal application, paste and run the script at the Terminal Prompt.

- After Homebrew has been installed, paste and run “brew install aubio --with-python” at the Terminal Prompt.
